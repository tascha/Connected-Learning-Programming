## Backwards Design {#backwards-design}

“Backwards design” is an approach to developing learning experiences. Starting with the desired outcomes for your program and how you will measure them, the process works in an “intentionally backwards”[^1] direction, planning the specific activities involved in the program last. In the following video, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder explain backwards design in more detail:

<p>An assessment of your library’s <b>capacity</b> examines the skills, knowledge, resources, and relationships your library has — for example, space, technology, expertise, staff time, or partnerships.  Determine what you have available, what you can reassign to support the program, and what you need to obtain or build before you can implement your program. See the Capacity module for more. </p>
<p>The <b>sustainability</b> of a program is “the ability to maintain programming and its benefits over time” (Washington University in St. Louis, 2012). Many library programs are initially funded by one-time grants, but unless a sustainability plan is developed before the grant ends they may falter when the external support ends.</p>

<p>Youth can and should be involved in the process of designing a program. Pima County Public Library used an IMLS grant to create a <a href="https://www.library.pima.gov/blogs/post/planning-101-how-the-youth-design-team-got-to-work/">Youth Design Team</a> that helped plan new programs that resonated with their community’s teens.</p></div>

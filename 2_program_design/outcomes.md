## Outcomes {#outcomes}

Designing a program starts with a thoughtful articulation of the outcome or outcomes you want to achieve through it. An outcome is simply something outside of your program and outside of connected learning that matters to someone.<sup><sup id="475227212516830-footnote-ref-4"><a href="#475227212516830-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></sup>

The outcomes you want from your programs should align with your library’s strategic mission as well as the goals and needs of your community.<sup><sup id="475227212516830-footnote-ref-5"><a href="#475227212516830-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup> But the desired outcome for any particular program doesn’t haven’t to be a high impact achievement. You may simply want to help your teens become more comfortable visiting the library space, or encourage friendships to form. Ask yourself (and your stakeholders): “What will the participants think, do, or feel as a result of their experience?”<sup><sup id="475227212516830-footnote-ref-6"><a href="#475227212516830-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup>

Talk to your stakeholders as you develop outcomes. They should all agree that the outcomes are important and desired. They may even suggest surprising or nontraditional outcomes. By involving your stakeholders, you can get different perspectives on what outcomes are the most important.<sup><sup id="475227212516830-footnote-ref-7"><a href="#475227212516830-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup>

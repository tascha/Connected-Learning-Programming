## Theory of Change {#theory-of-change}

Once you have decided where you’re going, you need to figure out how to get there. A theory of change explains “how and why the program will work.”[^1] It describes how your program will help you get from where you are to your desired outcomes in both narrative and graphic formats. A theory of change can be messy, recursive, and multidimensional, just like reality.[^2] A different approach is to create a logic model, in which the “how and why” are broken down into components arranged in a more logical order. Connell and Kubisch (1998) describe a good theory of change as _plausible_, _doable_, and _testable_. In either case, work backwards from your outcomes until you reach the specific activities that will begin the change you want to see.

In this video, Jay Memmot lists five steps to developing a theory of change:

_Fun activities &gt; participants enjoy the robotics lab &gt; participants become more interested in robotics &gt; participants want to learn more about robotics_

_Materials spread across different round worktables &gt; participants socialize with each other &gt; participants give each other advice and feedback &gt; participants collaborate on projects &gt; participants develop collaboration skills_

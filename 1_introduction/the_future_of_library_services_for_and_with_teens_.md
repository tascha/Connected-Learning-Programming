## The Future of Library Services for and with Teens: A Call to Action {#the-future-of-library-services-for-and-with-teens-a-call-to-action}

In this already-seminal work, published in 2014, Linda W. Braun, Maureen L. Hartman, Sandra Hughes-Hassell, Kafi Kumasi, and Beth Yoke present a modern vision of teen library services that embrace diversity, build 21st century skills, and engage teens as active participants in their own learning. The 21st century library is a “kitchen for mixing resources” that equips teens to navigate the modern, digital-centric world.

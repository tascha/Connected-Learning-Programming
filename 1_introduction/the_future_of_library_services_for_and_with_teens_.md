Braun, Maureen L. Hartman, Sandra Hughes-Hassell, Kafi Kumasi, and Beth Yoke present a modern vision of teen library services that embrace diversity, build 21st century skills, and engage teens as active participants in their own learning. The 21st century library is a “kitchen for mixing resources” that equips teens to navigate the modern, digital-centric world.

## The YALSA Teen Programming Guidelines {#the-yalsa-teen-programming-guidelines}

In conjunction with the _Future of Library Services_, YALSA developed an extensive set of guidelines for teen programming that exemplifies the new way of approaching youth services, including the recommendation to develop programs that support connected learning. ConnectedLib complements many of the YALSA guidelines, including:

* create programming that reflects the needs and identities of all teens in the community \(see the Community Mapping module\)
* facilitate teen-led programs \(see the Mentoring module\)
* develop interest-based, developmentally appropriate programs that support connected learning \(see the Youth Development module\)
* develop rich, mutually beneficial community partnerships \(see the Community Partnership module\)
* engage in youth-driven, evidence-based evaluation and outcome measurement \(see the Evaluation and Assessment module\)
* ensure that programs are staffed sufficiently and appropriately, providing staff with the training and knowledge they need \(see the Capacity module\)
* use human-centered approaches to program development and involve teens in the process \(see the Design Thinking module\)

Connected learning looks beyond traditional programming models and even beyond the library for learning opportunities, leveraging community partners and teens themselves as valuable resources. We’ll look at some of these in section 3, but first we’ll learn about program design.
